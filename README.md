# Automatic-nightlight
An automatic nightlight on BBC mirco:bit with a light sensor for a household.

Functionality:
Using a light sensor with MicroPython to create an automatic nightlight on micro:bit. With using the light sensor that I increased the sensitivity on its adjustor to measure the surrounding intensity of light, I defined different light levels by MicroPython. The micro:bit output light through the LEDs built-in function. The output light vary with the surrounding intensity of light automatically. When the surrounding intensity of light reaches the per-set levels, micro:bit will output the amount of light which I defined, otherwise micro:bit will maintain a dimmer heart image as usual.

Remaining work:
Will build a paper box fitting with the nightlight for a great look.
